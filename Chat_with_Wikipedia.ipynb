              "'Page: Barbie\\nSummary: Barbie is a fashion doll created by American businesswoman Ruth Handler, manufactured by American toy company Mattel and launched in 1959. The toy is the figurehead of the Barbie brand that includes a range of fashion dolls and accessories. Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over six decades. Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company\\'s largest and most profitable line. The brand has expanded into a multimedia franchise since the late 1980s, including video games, computer-animated films, and a live-action film.\\nBarbie and her male counterpart, Ken, have been described as the two most popular dolls in the world. Since its launch, Barbie has transformed the toy business in affluent communities globally by becoming a vehicle for the sale of related merchandise (accessories, clothes, friends and relatives of Barbie, etc.). Writing for Journal of Popular Culture in 1977, Don Richard Cox noted that Barbie has a significant impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale lifestyle that can be shared with affluent friends.Sales of Barbie dolls declined sharply from 2014 to 2016. In 2020, Mattel sold $1.35 billion worth of Barbie dolls and accessories, and this was their best sales growth in two decades. This is an increase from the $950 million the brand sold during 2017. According to MarketWatch, the release of the 2023 movie Barbie is expected to create \"significant growth\" for the brand until at least 2030. As well as reinvigorated sales, the release of the movie has triggered a fashion trend known as \"Barbiecore\".\\n\\nPage: List of Barbie\\'s friends and family\\nSummary: This article shows the complete fictional and non-fictional friends and family of Barbie, a fashion doll manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel and launched on 9 March 1959.\\n\\nPage: Barbie (film)\\nSummary: Barbie is a 2023 American fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig, who wrote the screenplay with Noah Baumbach. Based on the Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel, it is the first live-action Barbie film after numerous computer-animated direct-to-video and streaming television films. The film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis. It features an ensemble supporting cast, including America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.\\nA live-action Barbie film was announced in September 2009 by Universal Pictures with Laurence Mark producing. Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018. Robbie was cast in 2019, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2021. The rest of the cast were announced in early 2022. Filming took place primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England and on the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July 2022.\\nBarbie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 21, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Its simultaneous release with Universal\\'s Oppenheimer led to the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon on social media, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed over $823 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest grossing film of 2023.\\n\\n'"

It also includes wars fought outside Ukraine by Ukrainian military. \\nThe Kyivan Rus' is considered as the first national Ukrainian state (together with Belarus and Russia), the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (Ruthenia) as its political successor, and after the period of domination by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the Cossack states (the Cossack Hetmanate and the Zaporozhian Sich). The Ukrainian Cossacks were also related to the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate, having many conflicts with them. By the late 18th century, Ukraine didn't have independent states anymore, because it was ruled by the more powerful states of the time, namely the Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire and the Austrian Empire. There were several internal armed conflicts between various Ukrainian ideological factions (sometimes with foreign support) in the first half of the 20th century (especially during the 1917–1921 Ukrainian War of Independence and the 1939–1945 Second World War), but modern Ukrainian militaries (since 1917) have been mostly fighting with armies of neighbouring states, such as the Russian Provisional Government (Kiev Bolshevik Uprising November 1917), the Russian SFSR (Ukrainian War of Independence 1917–1921), the Second Polish Republic (Polish–Ukrainian War 1918–1919), Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (Second World War and post-War resistance), and since 2014, the Russian Federation (Russo-Ukrainian War).\\n  Ukrainian victory   Ukrainian defeat   Another result (e.g. a treaty or peace without a clear result)   Ongoing conflict\",\n",

            "**Answer**: The design of the atomic bomb was a collaborative effort by scientists and engineers involved in the Manhattan Project. The project was led by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who directed the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. Oppenheimer and his team, which included scientists such as Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, and Richard Feynman, worked on developing the design and technology for the atomic bomb. The specific designs for the two types of atomic bombs used in World War II, \"Little Boy\" and \"Fat Man,\" were created by different teams within the project. \"Little Boy\" was based on an enriched uranium gun-type design, while \"Fat Man\" used a plutonium implosion-type design. \n",

During this time, scientists and engineers worked on various aspects of the bomb's design, including theoretical calculations, experimental research, and testing. The first successful test of an atomic bomb, codenamed Trinity, took place in July 1945.
